# Deepguard-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
- The increasing rate of credit card fraud poses significant financial and security risks to consumers and financial institutions. A robust and automated system is urgently required to detect and flag fraudulent transactions in real-time.
- Credit card fraud can manifest in various forms, occurring both online and offline. Numerous methods are available for detecting such fraudulent activities, with research suggesting that machine learning algorithms are particularly effective in identifying and mitigating such risks. Notable algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest & CNN have been instrumental in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection processes.
- In the project “DeepGuard”, we aim to achieve a high level of accuracy in credit card fraud detection by leveraging sophisticated machine learning and deep learning techniques.
# Objective:
The "DeepGuard" project aims to devise two predictive models using machine and deep learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions. By analyzing regular patterns, these models can differentiate genuine transactions from fraudulent ones. Our focus is on maximizing fraud detection with minimal false alerts, treating this as a classification challenge. Data preprocessing and PCA transformations are integral to our approach. 
# Modeling:
1. Logistic Regression: This technique is versatile, and suited for regression and classification tasks, but is predominantly used for the latter. Logistic regression leverages dependent variables to forecast categorical outcomes. <br>
2. Decision Tree: This tool addresses both classification and regression challenges by branching decisions based on data attributes. <br>
3. Random Forest: This classifier harnesses multiple decision trees, each analyzing a data subset, and then consolidates their insights to enhance prediction accuracy for the entire dataset. <br>
4. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): KNN operates by classifying data points based on how their neighbors are classified, making it effective for pattern recognition tasks. <br>
5. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): CNN is a deep learning algorithm primarily utilized for image analysis. It processes data with a grid-like topology, like an image, identifying patterns through various layers of information processing.
# Performance & Conclusion:
- The performance of our machine learning models was thoroughly evaluated on these resampled datasets. We employed a Random Forest Classifier, a model known for its high accuracy and robustness against overfitting.
- The results were promising: the undersampled dataset model demonstrated considerable precision and recall, while the oversampled dataset model showed improvements in recall, which is critical in fraud detection as it measures the model’s ability to catch as many fraudulent transactions as possible. Further into our project, we explored other algorithms to broaden our understanding and improve our detection strategy. We worked with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors), and even delved into deep learning with a 1D Convolutional Neural Network.
- Each model was trained and evaluated on the same train-test split to ensure consistency. We computed various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score, to judge the performance of each model. Moreover, we utilized confusion matrices to visualize the performance and ROC curves to summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate at various thresholds.
- Our findings revealed that while some models excelled in accuracy, others had higher precision or recall. We needed to focus on the F1 score, as it balances the precision-recall trade-off—especially important in the context of fraud detection, where both false positives and false negatives carry significant costs.
- The deep learning model provided insights into the benefits of using more complex architectures for pattern recognition in data, and it showcased how neural networks can be applied to structured data.
- In conclusion, the project highlighted the importance of selecting the right metrics and models based on the specific context of the problem. The fusion of resampling techniques and diverse machine learning algorithms proved to be an effective strategy in detecting fraudulent activities in credit card transactions. Our future work will aim to refine these models further, explore the impact of feature engineering, and leverage more sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms to enhance our fraud detection capabilities.
